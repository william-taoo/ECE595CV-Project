## ECE 595CV Term Paper Project

I am reimplementing the following paper: 
DynamicDet: A Unified Dynamic Architecture for Object Detection.
The paper proposes a dynamic framework that reduces computational 
complexity by labeling an image as "easy", or "hard", allowing the model
to skip extra computation if not necessary.
